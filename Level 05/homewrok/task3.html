<p>Programming language history</p>

<p> programming language is a set of instructions written by a programmer to deliver instructions to the computer to perform and accomplish a task.</p>

<p>There are three types of programming languages: machine language, assembly language, and high-level language. Machine language is easier for the computer to understand but harder for the programmer to understand. This is because machine language is simply the language of machines—bits.</p>

<p>According to Wikipedia, there are more than 700 programming languages in the world. They are used for different purposes and bring different functions.</p>

<p>the Most used programming languages among developers worldwide as of 2024 are:</p>
<p>JavaScript</p>
<p>HTML/CSS	</p>
<p> and Python</p>
<p>In 1843, before the invention of computers, the first programming language was created by Ada Lovelace, one of the earliest female mathematicians.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The first high-level programming language was Plankalkül, created by Konrad Zuse between 1942 and 1945.</p>
